## Automated Testing

### Lighthouse

### HTML validator

- Index.html page has zero warning or errors

![index Html](assets/images/testing-images/index-html-validator.webp)

- Quiz.html has 8 warnings for possible misuse of aria-label, which I have chosen to ignore as for the context of which I use the icons with the aria-label to display the life lines I feel they would be useful.
